      <h3>Welcome to Fill Master!</h3>
      <h5>A random idea generator and improvisation helper.</h5>
      Fill Master is a web app (designed for use on your phone). It has 3 objectives.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>To get you out of your comfort zone</h4>
        </li>
        The random idea generators are designed to help you think outside the box and get out of
        your comfort zone. It&apos;s a technique used by many musicians. A guitarist lacking
        inspiration may say: &ldquo;Today I&apos;m going to play in the key of F minor, and only use
        three chords&rdquo;. This is the same concept but with drums and rhythm in mind.
        <li>
          <h4>To guide you in your improvisations</h4>
          There are helper sounds for when to play your fill and there are plans to add more helpers
          like these in the future. These give you the confidence that you&apos;re doing it right
          without needing to think about it, until it becomes second nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Real world learning.</h4>
          You could call Fill Master a &apos;Magic Free&apos; education app. It doesn&apos;t promise
          to make you a better musician on it&apos;s own. In fact the app would be pretty useless in
          isolation. The intended purpose of the app is to be used as a tool whilst you&apos;re at
          your kit. It&apos;s designed to encourage you to play and learn by doing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      This software is open source and growing. We plan to eventually have different levels of
      difficulty from beginner to professional, so all levels of drummer will want this tool in
      their arsenal. We want the metronome alone to be the best on the web, so it can be a one-stop
      shop for your time keeping and improvisation needs.
