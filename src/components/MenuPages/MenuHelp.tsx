      <h4>The basics if you can&apos;t count music</h4>
      <h5> Example:</h5>
      Stick to 4/4 timing. Count 1, 2, 3, 4. Kicks generally go on beats 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now count &apos;1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 AND&apos;. Change the metronome division to eighth notes
      and count along. Put some hats on the 8ths (all the clicks you hear).
      <br />
      <br />
      Now Try saying 1 e + a 2 e + a 3 e + a 4 e + a. These are 16th notes. Change the metronome
      division to 16ths notes if you wish to hear it. Try putting an extra kick on the
      &apos;e&apos;, &apos;and&apos; or &apos;a&apos; of your choice.
      <br />
      <br />
      Try putting the metronome division back to quarter notes and see if you can play your drum
      groove without the aid of hearing all the 16ths.
